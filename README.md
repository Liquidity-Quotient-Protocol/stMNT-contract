üõ°Ô∏è LiQ Quotient Protocol (stMNT) - Audited & Verified on Mantle

This repository contains the source code, deployment details, and security audit information for the LiQ Quotient Protocol, a multi-strategy yield vault built with Solidity and the Yearn V2 framework, deployed on the Mantle Network.

The primary goal of this protocol is to offer a liquid staking solution for the MNT token, which does not natively provide staking rewards. Users can deposit WMNT (Wrapped MNT) and receive an interest-bearing token, stMNT, which appreciates in value over time. This yield is generated through a diversified set of automated DeFi strategies and is further enhanced by a yield boost from the project's foundation.

üìÇ Source Code & Architecture

    contracts/Vault.sol: The core vault contract, based on Yearn V2. It manages user deposits, withdrawals, and share accounting. The initialization logic has been moved to the constructor to resolve the critical H-1 audit finding.

    contracts/Strategy1st.sol: A strategy that deposits WMNT into the Init Protocol to generate yield. Access control is managed via the Yearn BaseStrategy roles.

    contracts/Strategy2nd.sol: A strategy that deposits WMNT into the Lendle Protocol lending pool. It also uses BaseStrategy for secure role management.

    test/: Contains an extensive test suite with over 30 test cases, including long-term stress tests simulating over two years of chaotic market activity, ensuring robustness and reliability.

üöÄ How It Works (For Users)
üß© What is the Vault?

The stMNT Vault is a DeFi smart contract that lets you:

    Deposit WMNT tokens.

    Receive stMNT shares that represent your portion of the vault.

    Earn passive, auto-compounding yield generated by multiple DeFi strategies working in parallel.

üõ†Ô∏è The Process

    Deposit: You deposit your WMNT tokens into the Vault.

    Receive Shares: You get stMNT shares in return. The value of these shares increases over time.

    Yield Generation: The Vault automatically allocates your funds to the most effective strategies (Init, Lendle, etc.).

    Withdraw: You can withdraw your funds at any time by redeeming your stMNT shares, receiving your initial WMNT plus all the yield it has generated.

üìä How Is the Yield Generated?

The yield comes from three distinct sources, creating a robust and diversified return:

    Strategy 1 (Init Protocol): Yield from lending activities on Init Protocol.

    Strategy 2 (Lendle): Yield from lending activities on the Lendle platform.

    Foundation Boost: The project's foundation periodically "donates" yield to the strategies. This is done by directly transferring WMNT to the strategy contracts, which is then reported as pure profit (gain) during the next harvest. This directly increases the pricePerShare for all vault users, boosting the APY without diluting the supply.

‚úÖ Security and Verification

This project prioritizes security and transparency.

    Professional Audit: The contracts have undergone a comprehensive security audit by Nemi. All identified issues, including one high-severity vulnerability, have been fixed and validated. The full report is available for public review.

    Extensive Testing: The protocol is backed by a comprehensive test suite with over 30 test cases, in-depth unit tests, and long-term stress tests simulating over two years of chaotic market activity, ensuring robustness and reliability.

    Contract Verification: All deployed smart contracts will be publicly verified on MantleScan. Links will be provided here as soon as they are available.
